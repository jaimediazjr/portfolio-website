                    This is the car I bought back in 2018 a 2002 BMW 330ci. When this model came out it was dubbed "The
                    best handling
                    car in America". Since it's 20 years old you can probably guess that it needs a lot of TLC. That's
                    why working on this car is a hobby of mine, typically I work on it with my little brother.

                <p class="article-border-invert">
                    I absolutely love Halloween with a passion. It's definitely my favorite holiday. I usually
                    binge-watch
                    horror movies with my family and go crazy with decorations all over the house. This is a picture
                    from October when
                    me and my brother went to a haunted house. Some of my favorite horror movies are The Babadook,
                    Terrifier, & Hereditary.

                    I've been working out since middle school. I can't say that I absolutely love it with a passion but
                    it's more of
                    a discipline I've developed over the years. It's a great way to keep yourself accountable and
                    overall it promotes
                    a healthy lifestyle. It also teaches you that motivation is only temporary and for long-lasting
                    results you must replace motivation with drive.

                <p class="article-border-invert">
                    I always enjoy a well-earned night out with friends after a hard week's work. Whether we're just
                    enjoying each other's
                    company or we go out to a restaurant, bar, or club. I'm lucky enough to have some close friends from
                    my childhood
                    who have always had my back. I've also gained some long-lasting relationships during my time in the
                    military as well.
