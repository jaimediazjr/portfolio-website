                        This is the car I bought back in 2018 a 2002 BMW 330ci. When this model came out it was dubbed "The best handling
                        car in America". Since it's 20 years old you can probably guess that it needs alot of TLC, you'd be right! That's 
                        why working on this car is a hobby of mine, typically I work on it with my little brother.

                        I absolutely love halloween with a passion. It's definitely my favorite holiday. I usually binge watch  
                        horror movies with my family and go crazy with decorations all over the house. This is a picture from October when 
                        me and my brother went to a haunted house. Some of my favorite horror movies are The Babadook, Terrifier, & Hereditary.

                        I've been working out since middle school. I can't say that I absolutely love it with a passion but it's more of 
                        a discipline I've developed over the years. It's a great way to keep yourself accountable and overall it promotes
                        a healthy lifestyle. It also teaches you that motivation is only temporary and for long lasting results you must be
                        replace motivation with drive.
